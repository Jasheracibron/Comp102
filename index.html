    <p><em>I'm Jasher C. Acibron, an 18-year-old singer and student from <strong>Dungo-an, Manjuyod</strong>. As a proud
            student of <a href="https://norsu.edu.ph/">Negros Oriental State University (NORSU) in Bais City</a>, I've
            been nurtured by the university's vibrant culture and community spirit.

            Music has always been my passion, and singing is my way of expressing myself and connecting with others. I
            believe that music has the power to inspire, uplift, and bring people together.

            As a young artist, I'm eager to share my voice and my message with the world. I'm excited to collaborate
            with fellow musicians, learn from industry professionals, and perform for audiences who appreciate the
            beauty of music.

            Let's harmonize our passions and make a difference through the power of music!"</em></p>
